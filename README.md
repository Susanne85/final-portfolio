## Description

This is an applicaion in which I showcase three applications that I have built.
The first application is an application that utilises third party APIs to allow a user to find the weather for any town/city in Australia.
  
The second application is an application that demonstrates my understanding of client server applications and modelling of data to undertake SQL searches of data.  The application allows a user to enter a blog on a technical subject, login into the application which then allows them to add comments to any blog, and update or detail their own blogs.

The third application demonstrates use of third party APIs, client server processing and the Model - View - Controller architecture.  The third application is an appointment booking application that allows a user to book, edit, delete and search for their appointments.  It is invoked in Heroku.
